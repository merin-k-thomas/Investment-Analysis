# Investment-Analysis
Spark Funds wants to invest where most other investors are investing. The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments.
Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:
    It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
    It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in
Goals of data analysis: 
    Investment type analysis: Comparing the typical investment amounts in the venture, seed, angel, private equity. 
    Country analysis: Identifying the countries which have been the most heavily invested in the past. 
    Sector analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors.
